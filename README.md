# Object-Oriented-Python-programming

Context: The goal is to create a grade book application using python programming. A grade book
maintains a record of scores that students have in all courses that they have
registered for. In addition, a grade book provides a list of all students who have
passed as well as a list of students who have course referrals/fails. A student is
considered to have failed if they have less than 60 in any course they have
undertaken. Each student undertakes five courses. For each course, each student
does five assignments as seen in the class Student. Each student object can
generate the student’s average mark using the method percentage_gen. See
Student class. Each course maintains the following details: instructor, TAs,
semester, course name, and class list. The class list maintains a list of Student
objects – i.e., the students who have registered for the course. This is shown in the
Course class.
